Unsupervised Music Clustering using Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

Dataset:
- GTZAN Genre Dataset
- Number of audio tracks: 1000
- Audio features: MFCC (20 coefficients)

Model:
- Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- Latent dimension: 16

Clustering:
- Algorithm: K-Means
- Number of clusters: 10

Evaluation Metrics:
- Silhouette Score: 0.2267
- Calinski–Harabasz Index: 452.61

Notes:
- Latent representations were learned in an unsupervised manner.
- Clustering was performed in the VAE latent space.
- Metrics indicate meaningful structure in the learned representations.

Hybrid (Audio + Lyrics) Clustering Results

Lyrics Features:
- TF-IDF (max features: 30)

Clustering Algorithms Evaluated:
- K-Means
- Agglomerative Clustering
- DBSCAN

Evaluation Metrics:
- K-Means Silhouette Score: 0.4165
- K-Means Davies-Bouldin Index: 1.0579
- Agglomerative Silhouette Score: 0.3947
- Agglomerative Davies-Bouldin Index: 1.1546

Notes:
- Hybrid features improved clustering quality compared to audio-only features.
- DBSCAN produced noise or a single cluster, which is expected for density-based methods on high-dimensional data.

Hard Task: Beta-VAE (Disentangled Representation)

Model:
- Beta-VAE (β = 4)
- Latent dimension: 16

Clustering Algorithm:
- K-Means (k = 10)

Evaluation Metrics:
- Silhouette Score: 0.1948
- Calinski–Harabasz Index: 307.46
- Davies–Bouldin Index: 1.3293

Notes:
- Beta-VAE encourages disentangled latent representations.
- Lower clustering scores compared to standard VAE are expected due to increased emphasis on disentanglement.
